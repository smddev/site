description: Corporate human resources services

We have implemented a number of services for the client company to work with human resources:

# The system for calculating wages and motivating employees
The client company has a large sales department in which employee salaries are calculated in a complex way
depending on a number of different indicators. We have developed a system for employees in the HR department
with which different salary schemes can be conveniently configured depending on which department the employee works in,
as well as a visual design of a payslip that shows employees how their salary is calculated
and what they have to do to increase their income.


# A 360-degree performance appraisal system for company employees
We have developed a corporate service through which employees can rate each other based on a defined set of criteria.
After the evaluation, employees and managers are provided with a wide range of analytical tools
to monitor performance trends, ratings, and conflicts in the company.

# Vacancy management
The system has implemented a fairly complex workflow for creating, approving and publishing job vacancies,
which involves a large number of people with different roles.
