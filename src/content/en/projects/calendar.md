description: Corporate calendar with Zoom/Webex conference booking
---
Our team has developed a corporate calendar where employees can conveniently book and manage
meetings using a fixed pool of corporate licenses for Zoom and Webex conferences.
The functionality of creating meetings based on the company's structure and lists of employees was implemented.
The system has also been integrated with Google and MS Exchange calendars.

## Outcome
The convenience and efficiency of the company's employees has improved.
