description: Breaking monolith ESB system of large telecom operator into microservices.
---
We helped our client, large telecom operator, to expand their modem business from serving individuals to legal entities.
Their existing monolith system was implemented on top of ESB and was no longer be able to meet the challenges of rapidly expanding functionality.
Our team has tackled the challenge by gradually breaking the monolith system into a set of microservices while applying the best known technologies.
This has helped to preserve the existing business-critical functionality while opening up the numerous opportunities to add more features and support new business needs.
