description: Online platform that allows travellers to build optimal trip itineraries, share travel experience and earn the money 
---
The mission of this venture project was to build an online marketplace where travellers and bloggers can meet together.
Bloggers publish their exciting travel stories, including rich media content and time and place recommendations.
The stories are kept in executable format such that any site visitor can create a real personalized itinerary out of the selected story, including 
real trip dates, ready-to-buy tickets and accommodation. Once the itinerary is purchased through the partner network 
(e.g. tickets are bought and accommodation is being charged) the author of the story get paid with the commission.
