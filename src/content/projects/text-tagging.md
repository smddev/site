description: We developed a number of automated solutions for texts tagging.
---
We implemented a standard text processing pipeline:
* Data gathering
  * Web-scraping
  * Development of tools for assessors
* Data cleansing and preprocessing (tokenization, stemming, TF-IDF)
* Texts clustering, topic modelling
* Learning number SVM, GBM or RF models
* Model selection, ensembling
* Ensemble post-processing, if needed
  * improve prediction results
  * reduce model complexity and memory requirements
* REST-service to expose learnt models to end customers
