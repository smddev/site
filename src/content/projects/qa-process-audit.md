The goal of the audit was to make proposals for QA processes in order to lower expenses and increase quality of products.

We've held over 30 meetings with the developers, quality engineers and tech. support both in-house and 3rd party vendors.

## Outcome

A detailed report was delivered to a top-tier telecom provider. Our recommendations were not limited to QA - developers also had got quite a lot to improve in their work.
