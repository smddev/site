description: Our customer was planning to invest money in a peer-to-peer ending system, but was not comfortable with its existing credit scoring solution. We were contracted to develop a model for prediction of default and overdue payment probabilities, based on socio-demographic data, provided by p2p lending service.

We developed several models for predicting default/overdue probabilities, using SVM and GBM tools, for two periods of loan historical data. We analyzed importance of predictors and effect of credit scoring changes. We figured out that the existing credit scoring is quite adequate for high-grade loans, but was able to improve predictions for lower grades.

## Outcome

Models for predicting probability of defaults and overdue payments.
