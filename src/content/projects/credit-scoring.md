Our customer was planning to invest money in a peer-to-peer ending system, but was not comfortable with its existing credit scoring solution.
We developed several models for predicting default/overdue probabilities, using SVM and GBM tools, for two periods of loan historical data. We analyzed importance of predictors and effect of credit scoring changes. We figured out that the existing credit scoring is quite adequate for high-grade loans, but was able to improve predictions for lower grades.

## Outcome

Models for predicting probability of defaults and overdue payments.
