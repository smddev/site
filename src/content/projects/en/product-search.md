description: Domain-specific search engine that interprets electronic component
  parameters from customer queries
---
A leading electronic component distributor approached us to automate their online purchasing workflow.

## Challenges

Their customers typically submit lists with product descriptions in free-form text, which must be manually matched to actual products by humans.

## Solution

We've developed an advanced NLP model that leverages Named Entity Recognition (NER) to extract key product parameters—such as electrical units, part numbers, dimensions, and case codes—from customer search queries. This enables precise and efficient product searches by automatically matching user intent with relevant products.

## Outcome

Our NLP model has achieved an impressive accuracy of approximately 90% in identifying electronic parts parameters, ensuring highly reliable and efficient product searches.
