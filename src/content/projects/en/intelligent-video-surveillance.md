description: Automating Maintenance Control and Workforce Safety with Artificial Vision
---
We've developed AI models for our Chinese clients to automate supervision in manufacturing and maintenance. Our solutions significantly reduce or eliminate the need for human intervention in key areas, including:
* Behavioral Analytics: Ensuring contingent workers complete required locomotive maintenance tasks at train depots.
* Workforce Safety: Verifying personnel wear necessary safety gear, such as special clothing and helmets, in manufacturing zones.

These AI-driven innovations enhance efficiency, reduce errors, and improve overall operational safety.
