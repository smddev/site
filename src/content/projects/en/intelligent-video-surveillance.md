description: Enhancing Maintenance Control and Workforce Safety through
  Automation and Artificial Vision
---
We have developed advanced AI solutions for our Chinese clients to automate manufacturing and maintenance supervision. Our technology significantly reduces or eliminates human intervention in key operational areas, including:

* ### Behavioral Analytics

  Ensuring qualified locomotive maintenance personnel complete all scheduled maintenance tasks at designated train depots.

* ### Workforce Safety

  Conducting systematic verification that all personnel wear mandatory personal protective equipment, including specified safety attire and approved head protection, throughout manufacturing zones.

## Outcome

These AI-driven innovations boost efficiency, minimize errors, and enhance overall operational safety.
