description: Automating control of maintenance processes and workforce safety
  with help of artificial vision
---
We have built a number of AI models for our customer in China that helps them to automate the supervision in manufacturing and maintenance areas.
Our solution substantially reduces or even eliminates the need of human work in solving such problems as:
* Behavioral analytics ensuring that contingent worker has fulfilled the list of required maintenance activities while serving locomotives in train depot
* Workforce safety - ensuring the personnel is wearing required security apparel (special clothes, helmets e.t.c.) in manufacturing area
