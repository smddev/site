description: Automating Maintenance Control and Workforce Safety with Artificial Vision
---
We have developed advanced AI solutions for our Chinese clients to automate manufacturing and maintenance supervision. Our technology significantly reduces or eliminates human intervention in key operational areas, including:

* **Behavioral Analytics:**
  Ensuring contingent workers complete required locomotive maintenance tasks at train depots.
* **Workforce Safety:**
  Verifying personnel wear necessary safety gear, such as special clothing and helmets, in manufacturing zones.

These AI-driven innovations enhance efficiency, reduce errors, and improve overall operational safety.
