description: This online platform enables travelers to plan ideal itineraries,
  share travel stories, and monetize their experiences
---
The mission of this venture project was to create an online marketplace connecting travelers and bloggers. Bloggers share their travel stories, incorporating rich media content and specific time and location recommendations. These stories are designed in an executable format, allowing site visitors to easily generate personalized itineraries based on the content. Users can customize these itineraries with their preferred travel dates, and purchase tickets and accommodations directly through our partner network. When a user purchases an itinerary through the network (e.g., booking tickets and accommodations), the story's author receives a commission.
