description: Custom security solution for a 1-hectare industrial construction site.
---
We designed a comprehensive web surveillance system for a 1-hectare industrial construction site, ensuring enhanced security and real-time visibility into project progress. By utilizing high-resolution 5MP IP cameras (2592x1944), we optimized camera placement to minimize the number required while maintaining thorough coverage. The system features indexed video storage, providing easy access to footage for monitoring and incident review.

## Outcome

The system remained in operation for several years, reliably serving the construction site until project completion.
