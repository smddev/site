The objective of the audit was to provide recommendations for improving QA processes to reduce costs and enhance product quality.

We conducted over 30 meetings with developers, quality engineers, and technical support teams, both in-house and from third-party vendors.

## Outcome

We delivered a comprehensive report to a leading telecommunications provider, detailing strategic recommendations that extended beyond quality assurance. The development team received substantial actionable insights for process improvements, enabling them to enhance their workflow efficiency and code quality.
