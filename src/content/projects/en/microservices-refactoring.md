description: Decomposing a Monolithic ESB System into Microservices for a Major
  Telecom Operator
---
We assisted a major telecom operator in expanding their modem business from individual consumers to legal entities. Their existing monolithic system, built on an ESB architecture, was unable to meet the demands of rapidly evolving functionality. Our team addressed this challenge by strategically decomposing the monolith into a suite of microservices, leveraging leading-edge technologies. This approach not only preserved business-critical functionality but also unlocked significant opportunities for feature enhancements and support for emerging business requirements.
