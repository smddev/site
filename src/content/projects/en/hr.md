We have implemented several services for the client company to manage human resources effectively:

# A system for calculating wages and motivating employees.
The client company operates a large sales department where employee salaries are determined by multiple complex indicators. To address this, we developed a system for the HR department that allows them to easily configure different salary schemes based on the employee's department. Additionally, the system includes a visually intuitive payslip design that clearly explains how salaries are calculated and provides actionable insights for employees to increase their earnings.

# A comprehensive 360-degree performance appraisal system for company employees
We have developed a corporate service that enables employees to evaluate each other based on predefined criteria. Following the evaluation, both employees and managers gain access to comprehensive analytical tools, allowing them to track performance trends, analyze ratings, and identify potential conflicts within the organization.

# Vacancy management solutions
The system features a sophisticated workflow for creating, approving, and publishing job vacancies. This process involves multiple stakeholders with diverse roles, ensuring comprehensive collaboration and oversight throughout the hiring cycle.
