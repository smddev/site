review: Unlike other vendors, Smart Design was willing to adapt their skills and tools to match what we were trying to do. 
        Internal teams can, now, better centralize and focus their QA efforts thanks to Smart Designâ€™s efforts. Personable and straightforward, they were easy to work with and provided key input across multiple fields. They took a customer-oriented approach, melding seamlessly with the internal culture.
